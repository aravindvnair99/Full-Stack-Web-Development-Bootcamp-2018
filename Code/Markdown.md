Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You can control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or \*.

Backslash Escapes

Markdown allows you to use backslash escapes to generate literal characters which would otherwise have special meaning in Markdown's formatting syntax.

_literal asterisks_

Markdown provides backslash escapes for the following characters:

\ backslash
() parentheses
' backtick
\# hash mark
\* asterisk
\+ plus sign
\_ underscore
\- minus sign(hyphen)
{} curly braces
. dot
[] square brackets
